# git-based-twitter

I would totally name this twitterm

Super dumb idea tbh.

Basically just utilize git to create a twitter like thing for terminal

Current Goal:
* [ ] Setup a basic view only model of twitter for terminals
*     [ ] Server Side
*     [ ] Client Side

* [ ] Feature: Support upvote and downvote system
* [ ] Feature: Support sort based on 'New' and 'Popular'
